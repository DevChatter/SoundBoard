# DevChatter SoundBoard
This project is a place for us to have fun and build a sound board together. It's intended to that all audio will be triggered by configurable keyboard shortcuts and that the app will run in the system tray only. It's currently a Winforms app that opens direcly to the system tray. I'm open to ideas about where we want to take this project. Let me know [on-stream](https://www.twitch.tv/devchatter) or in the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/DevChatter/SoundBoard/issues) what you want to do.
